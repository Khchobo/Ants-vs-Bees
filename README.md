# Ants-vs-Bees
Lab 5 for CS 361. A turn based game similar to Plants vs. Zombies. In this game Ants vs. Bees, Bees
are the enemy and they move from right to left towards the queen in the first tile on the gameboard.
In order to win all bees must be wiped from the board. This is done by purchasing and deploying different
ant units which have different specialties / attacks. Alternatively, if the bees reach the queen in tile 1,
then the queen is killed and the bees win.
